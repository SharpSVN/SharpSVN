<h1>SharpSvn Snapshots</h1>

  <p>
    The SharpSvn project provides frequent builds of the current development tree. These versions
    are not always fully tested at the time of release, but may contain relevant bugfixes that
    are not in released versions yet. All builds available here have completed our testsuite and
    are generally good enough for production use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SharpSvn binaries were designed to allow full side by side usage, so it is no problem
    to have different versions loaded side-by-side in the same application. In general it is
    recommended to run a SharpSvn based on the last Subversion release of a specific branch
    as this has the latest bugfixes at this level. SharpSvn only adds a tiny wrapping layer
    above Subversion and its dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you report problems with these builds, please report those issues with the exact
    version. The version you might call "latest" might already be outdated after you've
    downloaded it.
  <p>
  <p>
    A final note: All these binaries are now also easily available via
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=SharpSvn">NuGet</a>.
