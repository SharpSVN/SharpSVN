<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>SharpSvn's original roadmap is completed. We implemented everything from our initial roadmap and SharpSvn is&nbsp;used by quite a few&nbsp;projects. For maintenance reasons we integrated the SharpSvn&nbsp;project with&nbsp;AnkhSVN (primary user and huge developer overlap).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* Keeping SharpSvn stable. </p><p>* Implement new features of Subversion in a .Net friendly way. </p><p>* Support project using SharpSvn with some forward compatibility where possible by pro-actively adding features that will be&nbsp;standard in new versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                </p>
